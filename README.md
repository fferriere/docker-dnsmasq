# docker-dnsmasq

This project permit to use dnsmasq under a docker container.
The dnsmasq configuration could be update after container.

## Installation

To install this container clone the repository run `dnsmasq.sh build` to build container.
You can customize image's name with `FFERRIERE_DNSMASQ_IMAGE` variable.
Example :
```
$ FFERRIERE_DNSMASQ_IMAGE='prefix/dnsmasq' ./dnsmasqh.sh build
```

You can edit dnsmasq config after run container. You do run `dnsmasq.sh reload` or `touch path_dnsmasq/reload` file. By default `path_dnsmasq` is `dnsmasq` folder of this project. You can change it with `-s|--src option` of `dnsmasq.sh`

For systemd user it's possible to run `sudo dnsmasq.sh install`. Run `sudo systemctl enable docker-dnsmasq` for run container at boot.
